# Welcome to my Coding Challenges Repo!

If you are a potential employer, the purpose of this repo is to hopefully showcase my programming skills. Hopefully on a regular basis, I will update this repo with smaller projects that will showcase my programming skills. 

In the meantime, enjoy what this repo has to offer! Hopefully this will be useful for you!
